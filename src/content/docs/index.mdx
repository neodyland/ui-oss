## Welcome to Neody UI!
- This is a collection of components designed to help you build beautiful and functional user interfaces quickly and easily.
- It is used in production across all Neody and MikanDev projects, so you can be sure that it is battle-tested and ready for any kind of use-case.
- We've now open-sourced it under the MIT license, so you can use it in your own projects as well!

## Simple installation and expandability
- Neody UI is compatible with the shadcn CLI, allowing you to easily install and use components in your projects.
- We also provide Next.js optimized versions of some components, [which are designed to work seamlessly with Next.js](/docs/nextjs-components), leveraging its features for better performance and user experience.
- There are also buttons provided to open components in [Vercel v0](https://v0.dev), allowing you to customize them to your needs!
