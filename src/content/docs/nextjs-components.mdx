import { Alert } from "@/components/alert";

Some of the components on offer here provide a "Next.js optimized version".<br/>
These components are designed to work seamlessly with Next.js, leveraging its features for better performance and user experience.<br/><br/>
Mainly, these components replace the default `img` and `a` tags with Next.js' `Image` and `Link` components respectively. This allows for automatic image optimization and client-side navigation, enhancing the overall performance of your Next.js applications.

<Alert title={"Warning"} variant={"solid"} type={"warning"}>Make sure to use the regular components when using a non-Next.js framework, such as React Router. Otherwise you will experience errors.</Alert>
